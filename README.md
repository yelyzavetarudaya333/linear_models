# Comparing linear regression models

In this project I will compare different linear regression models accuracy using House Prices Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.

The goal of this project:
 - practice building logistic regression, ridge regression, lasso regression models using Scikit-learn;
 - compare these models on this particular task;
